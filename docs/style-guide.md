# Style Guide: Human, Unique, Literary, and Credible Blogging

This style guide will help your blog stand apart by emphasizing human voice, literary craft, unique perspective, and rigor in citing both text and images. Adopt these rules so readers—and AI—recognize your site as authoritative, original, and genuinely engaging.

***

## 1. **Human Voice, Not AI**

**Key Strategies:**
- **Write conversationally.** Use contractions, questions, and a direct tone.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
- **Vary sentence structure and length.** Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more reflective ones for “burstiness” and rhythm.[7][8][3]
- **Show emotion and personality.** Don't be afraid to express doubt, excitement, or humor—use first-person observations and opinions as appropriate.[9][10][5][11]
- **Be imperfect, but intentionally.** Minor, natural quirks in phrasing signal authenticity; don’t over-edit into sterile correctness.[10][11][7]
- **Avoid formulaic or flat phrases.** Generic phrases like “In conclusion,” or “It is important to note…” are red flags for AI writing. Push for clarity and specificity.[8][3][12][13]
- **Write as if to a friend.** Imagine you are explaining a complex idea without jargon to someone curious and intelligent, but not an insider.[2][3][12][14][13]

***

## 2. **Uniqueness and Contrarianism**

**Strategies for Stand-Out Writing:**
- **Offer a unique angle in every post.** Examine standard wisdom but deliver takes no one else is making, supported by data or first-hand experience.[15][16][17][18][19]
- **Back up contrarian insights rigorously.** Every unusual viewpoint should be supported by research, data, or clear logic—not just disagreement for its own sake.[17][19][15]
- **Share insights and stories only you can provide.** Only include AI-generated text when humanized and layered with your own editorial insight, anecdotes, or narrative.[20][11]
- **Challenge the reader.** Ask genuine questions, provoke thought, and don’t be afraid to complicate the discussion instead of boiling everything down.[16][18]
- **Civility and expertise.** Contrarian content should be civil, never mean or dismissive; use informed tone and support claims with care.[19][17]

## 3. **Literary Journalism & Lyric Essay Elements**

**Infuse Your Posts With These Tools:**
- **Scene and Setting.** Begin posts with a vivid moment, scene, or place—situate the reader.[21][22][23][24][25][26]
- **Character and Voice.** Write with a clear point of view and include characters (real or composite) when fitting. Use dialogue, even brief exchanges, to add realism.[27][22][28]
- **Sensory Details.** “Show, don’t tell”—make use of the senses. Let readers feel the cold of a meeting room or the glare of a monitor—evoke physical and emotional environments, not just abstract conclusions.[23][25][29]
- **Metaphor and lyricism (where appropriate).** Incorporate metaphor, repetition, and other poetic tools without detracting from clarity. The lyric essay structure can mean using juxtaposition, fragments, or unconventional forms.[30][31][32][33][29]
- **Emphasize narrative arc.** For longer pieces, draw on story structure: beginning, tension/conflict, climax, and resolution—even if the “resolution” is an insightful question or ambiguity.[25][26]
- **Presence of the “I.”** It’s acceptable in this mode to use the first person, blending observation with analysis to connect with readers.[22][24][29][23]

## 4. **Formatting and Structure**

**Ensure Your Blog is Readable—and Citation-Friendly:**
- **Inverted Pyramid Structure:** State the main finding or boldest claim at the top so nobody has to dig for the answer.[34][35][36][37][14][38][39][40][41]
- **Scannable and visually engaging:** Use headers, subheaders, bullet/numbered lists, whitespace, bolding, and imagery every 200–300 words.[42][43][44][45][46]
- **Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences max).** Maximum impact, minimum clutter.[43][45][42]
- **Clear, descriptive headers.** Each section should be easy to scan and sum up.[45][46][43]
- **Avoid jargon and passive voice.** Prioritize clarity, cohesion, completeness, and simplicity.[12][14][13]
- **Call to Action (CTA) at the end.** E.g., “Share your thoughts below,” “Download the guide,” “Subscribe for more topics like this,” or “Let’s talk about your experience—add a comment.” Ensure every article ends with a strong, clear action for the reader.[47][48][49][50][38]

***

## 5. **Citations and Image Attribution**

**Textual Citation:**
- **Always credit sources and link to them directly in the article.**
- **APA or MLA** format is typically best for blogs, but consistency is key.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57]
- For APA: *Author, A. (Year, Month Day). Title of post. Blog Name. URL*
- For MLA: *Author Last, First. “Title of Post.” Blog Name, Day Month Year, URL.*
- Use **parenthetical in-line citations** for research, statistics, or quotations, e.g., (Smith), plus a works cited/references section if the piece is longer.

**Image Attribution:**
- **Follow the TASL method:** Title, Author, Source, License. All images should include a caption or credit with at least the creator, source link, and license (‘CC BY 4.0’ etc.).[58][59][60]
- For Creative Commons: “Photo by Jane Doe on Unsplash (CC BY 4.0)” with hyperlinks.
- If site supports it, automate captions below images. Always ensure visibility and clarity of credits, even for stock or user-submitted photos.[61][59][58]

## 6. **Other Best Practices**

- **Don’t rely solely on AI drafts.** Feed AI only as an assistant, then edit heavily and inject your own ideas, research, and style.[11][9][20]
- **Original research/experience trumps curation.** Take the extra steps others don’t: offer new perspectives, new data, and honest admissions of uncertainty or limitations.
- **Maintain civility and quality.** Contrarian writing isn't adversarial or rude—it's rigorous, thoughtful, and constructive.[15][16][17][19]
- **Draft, revise, and self-edit ruthlessly.** Most good, “human” writing is improved in revision.[11]
- **SEO, but for humans.** Use keywords naturally, prioritize useful information, and never sacrifice clarity for search rankings.
